CodeSharp is a small CMS based on CodeIgniter.

Currently in Alpha version. You can download a version here: 

1. Create the database and include the database details in file application/config/database.php

Change the $config['base_url'] value to your domain name in application/config/config.php

Run install file : http://www.example.com/install.php

Enter values requested

This will install a full version of CodeSharp

Afterwards, change the error level in the main index file to production if coding work is to continue

[At the moment there is a hack method of installing the files. This will change in a forthcoming version]
